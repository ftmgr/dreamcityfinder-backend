## Features

- **RESTful API**: Provides RESTful endpoints for accessing and manipulating city data.
- **Mock Database**: Utilizes `json-server` to create a full fake REST API with zero coding in less than 30 seconds (great for testing and development).
- **Easy Setup**: Simple and quick setup, with a focus on ease of use in development environments.

## Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **json-server**: Get a full fake REST API with zero coding.
